# Hiraeth Guitars

Hiraeth Guitars is an imagined luthier of fine hand-made acoustic guitars. Based in Wales; Hiraeth is an almost untranslatable Welsh word meaning "a mixture of longing, yearning, nostalgia, wistfulness or an earnest desire for the Wales of the past."
The Goals of the project are:
 * To showcase the products on offer
 * Inform the user of the options available when ordering a product
 * Allow the user an easy process to place and order
 * Develop a sense of trust about the brand

## 1.Strategy
---
* Project Purpose
   * To showcase and promote a range of fine handmade guitars.
   * To clearly communicate the range of wood options and body styles on offer, and educate users on their tonal impact on the guitar build.
   * To create a space to display past and current work of the luthier, alongside information about the products.

* I wanted all content on the site to be clearly displayed in a concise manner.
* I wanted a downloadable resource to inform users of current prices when accounting for all available options.
* A responsive site that functions well across a range of devices and screensizes.
## 3.Structure
---
* The site features a clear and intuitive navigation bar and footer, that responds to different screen sizes.

### Colour Scheme

The main colours used in development of the website are a darker and lighter shade of purple, a light grey, and an off white. I chose these as I felt they made the site inviting and imbued a sense of warmth.

![Color Scheme](assets/compressed-images/color-scheme-7.jpg)

### Typography

The two fonts used are "Playfair Display" for all the body content, and "Satisfy" for the logo. Both are backed-up by "Sans-Serif" should they fail to load from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com).

![Google fonts](assets/compressed-images/google-fonts.png)

### Imagery

The imagery used throughout the site is intended to showcase the works of the luthier; with many examples of previous work, images of both the workshop, and wood harvesting process, and examples of possible wood and body style options for the instruments.

I have chosen to use a large and striking image of a beautifully made guitar as the index.html page's hero image. This is to quickly capture the attention of prospective customers. 

## Features
---
### Landing Page Image

A striking a beatiful image was used for the landing page. This is animated to catch the users attention.
Overlayed across the image is some hero text to instantly convey the nature of the site to users, and a products button to take the user to view the range of guitars on offer.

### Navigation bar

Consistent throughout the website is a sleek and intuitive navigation bar. The main features of the navbar are:

* Logo text that links to the home page.
* Active link colours to indicated the current page the user is on.
* Hover colours for the links. 
* A drop down menu for the pricing link that offers a PDF for the pricing as both a viewable link and a download link.
* The navbar collapses into a toggle drop-down button on smaller screensizes.

## Technologies Used
---
### Languages Used

* HTML5
* CSS3

### Framework & Libraries Used

* Bootstrap 4.4.1:
  * Bootstrap was utilised to quickly build a responsive framework for the website, before being overwritten to add my own style.

2. Google Fonts:
   * Google Fonts was used to import the "Satisfy" and "Playfair Display" fonts into my style sheet. I also used Google Fonts to download these fonts to my machine for creating the "Price List" PDF in Affinity Photo.

3. Font Awesome:
   * Font Awesome was used to provide icons to social media on all of the webpages in my project.

4. Git:
   * Git was used for version control to backup my project. I did this through terminal commands to commit to Git and push externally to GitHub.

5. GitHub:
   * GitHub was used to store all of my project code after being pushed from Git.

6. Affinity Photo/Publisher:
  * Affinity software was used to create my "Price List" PDF. 

7. Balsamiq:
  * Balsamiq was used to generate my wireframes to guide my design process.

8. Logic Pro X
  * Logic Pro X was used to capture and edit the audio for the products page. I improvised an acoustic track, and then Equalised it 9 different times to represent the effect of the wood/body choice on the products page.

## Further Testing
---
### Validator Results

* All Html pages passed through the official Jigsaw validator with no errors.

* The CSS stylesheet passed through the official W3C validator with no issues, aside from the Safari Media queries "Stroke-color" property not being recognised. I attempted to resolve this but changing it caused my Safari browser bug fix to no longer work.

### Device Testing

* The website was tested on multiple web-browsers including Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Brave.

* The website was viewed on multiple devices with varying screen sizes. These include iPhone 11's, iPad air, iPad pro, 16 inch Macbook pro and a 13 inch Acer laptop.

* All links and pages were tested thoroughly across various browsers and screen sizes.

* Family members trialled the website on their own devices to both give feedback and look for bugs. 

### Known Bugs

* On one of the iPads tested, when using the Safari browser the hero image on index.html only loads halfway. This did not happen when using the Chrome browser instead. 

* On the iPad air the hero image loads roughly 3/4 of the way when using Safari.

### Notable Solved Bugs

* When using the Safari browser on any device, the font awesome icons in the footer displayed further left than intended. On all other browsers they displayed where I meant them too.

   a. I solved this by using Safari only media queries to push the icons over by 70px. The solution was my own idea, however I googled the code for the Safari media queries, and found it on [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/create-browser-specific-css). 

* When testing the website using Chrome Developer tools, white space appeared to the right of the webpage when the screen size was reduced enough. 

a. I googled this issue and found a solution. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4617872/white-space-showing-up-on-right-side-of-page-when-background-image-should-extend/5805134]) suggested that the code snippet 

`html,body
{
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 0px;
    overflow-x: hidden; 
}`

would solve the issue. This worked to some extent, however the "overflow-x:hidden" caused content on the right-hand side of the website to not display on larger screens. To solve this I set the overflow to visible and wrote a media query that sets it back to hidden when the breakpoint is reached for the white space to appear.  

`@media screen and (max-width:700px) {
    html, body{
        overflow-x:hidden;
    }`
