## Further Testing

### Validator Results

* All Html pages passed through the official Jigsaw validator with no errors.

* The CSS stylesheet passed through the official W3C validator with no issues, aside from the Safari Media queries "Stroke-color" property not being recognised. I attempted to resolve this but changing it caused my Safari browser bug fix to no longer work.

### Device Testing

* The website was tested on multiple web-browsers including Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Brave.

* The website was viewed on multiple devices with varying screen sizes. These include iPhone 11's, iPad air, iPad pro, 16 inch Macbook pro and a 13 inch Acer laptop.

* All links and pages were tested thoroughly across various browsers and screen sizes.

* Family members trialled the website on their own devices to both give feedback and look for bugs. 

## Known Bugs

* On one of the iPads tested, when using the Safari browser the hero image on index.html only loads halfway. This did not happen when using the Chrome browser instead. 

* On the iPad air the hero image loads roughly 3/4 of the way when using Safari.

## Notable Solved Bugs

* When using the Safari browser on any device, the font awesome icons in the footer displayed further left than intended. On all other browsers they displayed where I meant them too.

   a. I solved this by using Safari only media queries to push the icons over by 70px. The solution was my own idea, however I googled the code for the Safari media queries, and found it on [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/create-browser-specific-css). 

* When testing the website using Chrome Developer tools, white space appeared to the right of the webpage when the screen size was reduced enough. 

a. I googled this issue and found a solution. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4617872/white-space-showing-up-on-right-side-of-page-when-background-image-should-extend/5805134]) suggested that the code snippet 

`html,body
{
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 0px;
    overflow-x: hidden; 
}`

would solve the issue. This worked to some extent, however the "overflow-x:hidden" caused content on the right-hand side of the website to not display on larger screens. To solve this I set the overflow to visible and wrote a media query that sets it back to hidden when the breakpoint is reached for the white space to appear.  

`@media screen and (max-width:700px) {
    html, body{
        overflow-x:hidden;
    }`


# Credits

## Code 

* Bootstrap4: Bootrap Library was used throughout the intial setup of the website to help with both responsivness and layout.

* Code from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4617872/white-space-showing-up-on-right-side-of-page-when-background-image-should-extend/5805134) and [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/create-browser-specific-css) was used to help solve the bugs listed in the bug section. I also used a snippet of code from a [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.com) lesson to create the hero image animation, however I then modified this for my own website.
